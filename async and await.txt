               ASYNC AND AWAIT
	----------------------------

Async is a modification that makes writting of promises much easier.Await is used with async for they work better together.
Furthermore it can only work with the presence of async, otherwise it wont be effective. Await ensures that all promises are sychronized,
ie, all the events are executed without jumping any irrispective of the time it has to take to finish.

 example
--------

function carol() {
  return new Promise(call => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      call("mwende");
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log("calling");
  var sound = await carol();
  console.log(sound);
 
}

asyncCall();

Java schript assignment of 29th Feb 2019

     Diffrence between Null and Undifined 

Undefined means that a variable has been declared but has the value of tha variable hasnot yet been defined.

                 var test1;
                 cosole.log(test2)
                     // undefined

Null means an empty or non-existent value. Null is assigned, and explicitly means nothing.

                 var test =null;
                 console.log(test1)
                        //null
